      "    \n",
      "    When users run your application they have to authenticate your app\n",

      "    to do this. Please see the twitter.oauth_dance module to see how this\n",
      "    is done. If you are making a command-line app, you can use the\n",
      "    oauth_dance() function directly.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Performing the \"oauth dance\" gets you an ouath token and oauth secret\n",
