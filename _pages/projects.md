**For each of these solutions, all writing should be your own.  The final delivered document will be inspected using the plagiarism tool available via Blackboard.**

## Kaggle Assignment 1 (Due on 10/23)
Public solutions/tutorials to Kaggle problems can be tremendous opportunities to learn data science.  Try goggling "Kaggle tutorial" or "Kaggle Solutions" through Google and [github](https://github.com).  

The goal of the first assignment is to understand data from an analytics problem as well as so that you see the overall process in action.  Overall, you should assess 2 different datasets and 3 total solutions.  

### Solutions 1-2: Titantic Dataset
Solutions 1-2 should be for the [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), and you should be able to get a prediction for each. One should be Python and one R.  You should compare differences in the solutions (in terms of performance) so both solutions must work.   Feel free to share comments with others in the class on which solutions work and which ones don't via [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z-TL0OTVpj6HpIIHrFwVglakvu3mJ-ZsYMoR38kCOmo/edit).

(1) Overview of Titanic Analytics Problem and Data.  You could provide descriptions of key fields.

(2) Solutions. Provide an overall summary of the approach including which features where created, how the the data was sampled, and the model used for the prediction. Going line by line through the solutions and commenting what they are doing is useful. 

(3) Compare the predictive performance of the R solution vs the Python solution.  

### Solution 3: Choose a solution to a problem from an active or closed [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) competition. 

(4) Overview of Analytics Problem and Data (1 page).

(5) Provide overview of solution/approach.

(6) Prepare 3 minute presentation on dataset and solution. 1 slide problem. 1 slide data. 1 slide solution. 


## Kaggle Assignment 2 (Due on 11/30)
For the second Kaggle assignment we are all going to enter the TBD contest.   

For this assignment, I'd like you to provide the following:

(1) Introduction and overview of the data.

(2) A series of blog style entries including your code, the things you tried, and the resulting outcomes.  

(3) Print out your resulting score and rank from 3 different entries to the competition.
